Welcome to a detailed reproduction of all analyses in the Dynamic Hazard paper, Urbut et al 2024.

[Figure 1](Fig1.html) Here is the hazard rate and proportion of variation explained in the UK Biobank and 

[Figure 1b](Fig1b.html) Here is the hazard rate and proportion of variation explained in the Framingham Offspring Cohort

[Figure 2](Figure2.html) Here are the relative and absolute rates of CAD by PRS and PCE percentile for three age categories

[Figure 3](Figure3.html) Here is the stratification by age and PCE using the UK Biobank

[Figure 4](Figure4.html) Here is the proportion of future events captured using a PCE threshold of 7.5% versus a PRS threshold of greater than 80% to predict future events

[Figure 1 Supplemental ](NRI.html) Here is the net reclassification of events and non events using PCE versus PRS


[Figure 2 Supplemental](SuppASCVD.html) Here is the proportion of individuals in each PCE risk class by age

# Validation

[Proportional Hazards](zph.html) Here is the demonstration cox PH is violated with typical model.

[Cum Events](cumulativeinc.html) Here I plot cumulative events by ACVD strata or by age.

[Density Plots](verifyplots.html) Here I show PRS distirbution for overall cohort, and for ours, with different scaling.

[Lipid Plot](StatinUse.html) Here I show detailed analysis of statin use by age of enrollment in the FOS.

[Sex Plot](Sex_analyse.html) Here I show detailed analysis of hazard ratios by sex in FOS and age of enrollment by menopause.

# Tables

We also have a variety of exlucsion tables and summary tables 

[Table 1](table1.html) Here is the summary characterisitics of each cohort, and of division by ASCVD and PRS risk calss in the UK Biobank subset

[Exclusions](flowcharts.html) Here are the flowcharts of exclusionary criteria for creating the cohorts used in these analyses.
